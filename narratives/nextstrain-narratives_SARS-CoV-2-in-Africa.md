# [Current patterns of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Africa](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/africa/2021-09-03?d=tree,map,frequencies&f_region=Africa&p=grid)

Delta dominates in Africa, less than a year after its emergence in early 2021.

# [Delta swept in less than a year](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/africa/2021-09-03?d=frequencies&f_region=Africa&p=full)

After initial waves of Beta and Alpha, Delta swept through Africa in a third wave.

# [Within Delta, the S:T95I mutation has spread across the continent](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/africa/2021-09-03?c=gt-S_95&d=tree,map,frequencies&f_region=Africa&label=clade:21A%20%28Delta%29&p=grid)

The T95I mutation in the spike protein S emerged in early 2021 and rose to 25% frequency in Africa by the middle of May.
Although it is now circulating at 10% frequency in Africa, this mutation represents the potential for subclades of Delta to emerge and spread.
